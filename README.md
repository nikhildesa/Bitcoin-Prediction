# Bitcoin-Prediction
1.Data cleaning, filling up missing data points
2.Remove unnecessary columns
3.Sort our data in ascending order based on date
4.plit the data for Training and Test
5.Create input samples and normalize them between 0 and 1
6.Create target outputs for the training and test sets and normalize them between 0 and 1
7.Convert our data to numpy array to be consumed by our model

# Model
